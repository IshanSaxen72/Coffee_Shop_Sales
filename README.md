# Coffee_Shop_Sales
## Coffee Shop Sales Prediction System
This system predicts coffee shop sales based on historical data and various features such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, promotions, and holidays. The goal is to help coffee shop owners optimize inventory, staff schedules, and improve overall decision-making.

## Features
Sales Forecasting: Predicts sales revenue for each day, week, or month based on historical data.
Time Series Analysis: Uses past sales data to predict future trends and demand patterns.
Weather and Holiday Impact: Includes weather data and holiday information to refine sales predictions.
Promotions and Discounts: Incorporates the effect of ongoing promotions or discounts on sales.
## Requirements
Before running the system, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
statsmodels
xgboost (or other machine learning models)
tensorflow (optional, for deep learning models)
You can install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coffee-shop-sales-prediction.git
cd coffee-shop-sales-prediction
Prepare the data:

Ensure you have a dataset containing sales data (e.g., CSV file). The dataset should ideally include features such as date, day_of_week, time_of_day, temperature, weather_condition, and sales_amount.

Place your data file in the data/ directory (or adjust the path in the script accordingly).

Train the model:

The model can be trained using a variety of machine learning algorithms. By default, it uses XGBoost. You can modify the model training parameters or switch to other models if needed.
Run the training script:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py
This will output the trained model, which can then be used to make predictions.

Making Predictions:

Once the model is trained, you can use the prediction script to forecast sales.
bash
Copy
python predict_sales.py
The predictions will be saved to a predictions/ folder.

## Data Structure
The dataset should contain the following columns (example):

date: Date of the sale (YYYY-MM-DD)
day_of_week: Day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday)
time_of_day: Hour of the day (e.g., 8:00 AM)
temperature: Weather temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
weather_condition: Condition (e.g., sunny, rainy)
promotion: Whether there was a promotion on that day (0 = no, 1 = yes)
holiday: Whether the day was a holiday (0 = no, 1 = yes)
sales_amount: Sales amount for that day (target variable)
Example Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Model Training: Train a predictive model using historical sales data and external features (weather, promotions, etc.).
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict sales for upcoming days or weeks based on relevant features.
Model Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
You can modify the evaluation script to include additional metrics as needed.

## Conclusion
This Coffee Shop Sales Prediction System is designed to help coffee shop owners make data-driven decisions on inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies. By predicting sales accurately, coffee shops can minimize waste, optimize staffing schedules, and improve profitability.
